	abstract = {A numerical integration method for guiding-center orbits of charged particles in toroidal fusion devices with three-dimensional field geometry is described. Here, high order interpolation of electromagnetic fields in space is replaced by a special linear interpolation, leading to locally linear Hamiltonian equations of motion with piecewise constant coefficients. This approach reduces computational effort and noise sensitivity, while the conservation of total energy, magnetic moment and phase space volume is retained. The underlying formulation treats motion in piecewise linear fields exactly and, thus, preserves the non-canonical symplectic form. The algorithm itself is only quasi-geometric due to a series expansion in the orbit parameter. For practical purposes, an expansion to the fourth order retains geometric properties down to computer accuracy in typical examples. When applied to collisionless guiding-center orbits in an axisymmetric tokamak and a realistic three-dimensional stellarator configuration, the method demonstrates stable long-term orbit dynamics conserving invariants. In Monte Carlo evaluation of transport coefficients, the computational efficiency of quasi-geometric integration is an order of magnitude higher than with a standard fourth order Runge–Kutta integrator.},

    abstract = {GORILLA: Guiding-center ORbit Integration with Local Linearization Approach GORILLA computes guiding-center orbits for charged particles of given mass, charge and energy in toroidal fusion devices with three-dimensional field geometry. This guiding-center orbit code is designed to be used in scientific plasma physics simulations in the field of magnetic confinement fusion. The guiding-center orbits are traced via a quasi-geometric integration method described in Ref. [1]. There, high order interpolation of electromagnetic fields in space is replaced by a special linear interpolation, leading to locally linear Hamiltonian equations of motion with piecewise constant coefficients. The underlying formulation treats the motion in the piecewise linear fields exactly. This further leads to conservation of total energy, magnetic moment and phase space volume. Furthermore, the approach reduces computational effort and noise sensitivity. Guiding-center orbits are computed without taking collisions into account. For various simulations in magnetic confinement fusion, direct modeling of guiding-center particle orbits is utilized, e.g. global kinetic computations of quasi-steady plasma parameters or fast alpha particle loss estimation for stellarator optimization. In such complex simulations a simple interface for the guiding-center orbit integration part is needed. Namely, the initial condition in five-dimensional phase space is provided (e.g. guiding-center position, parallel and perpendicular velocity) and the main interest is in the condition after a prescribed time step while the integration process itself is irrelevant. Such a pure “orbit time step routine” acting as an interface with a plasma physics simulation is provided (`orbit\_timestep\_gorilla`). However, the integration process itself can be of high interest as well, thus, a program allowing the detailed analysis of guiding-center orbits, the time evolution of their respective invariants of motion and Poincaré plots is at disposal as well (`gorilla\_plot`). Both applications are realized for demonstration in the program (`test\_gorilla\_main`).   References: [1] M. Eder, C.G. Albert, L.M.P. Bauer, S.V. Kasilov and W.
